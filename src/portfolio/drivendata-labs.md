description: "DrivenData is a startup based out of the Harvard Innovation Lab that seeks to create social impact through crowdsourced data analysis competitions. I started working with DrivenData on a redesign of their competition platform. I've since worked with them on a number of projects, and recently created this new landing page for their consulting services."
