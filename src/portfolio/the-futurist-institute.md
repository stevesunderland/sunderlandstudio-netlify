title: "The Futurist Institute"
description: "The Futurist Institute is an online learning platform created for one of the world's leading economic futurists. This project involved designing a logo, brand identity and website. I also created a custom web application using Django which functions as a Learning Management System (LMS) and allows the client to sell access to their courses and monitor student progress. "
