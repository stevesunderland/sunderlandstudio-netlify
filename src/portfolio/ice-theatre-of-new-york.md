description: "We first started working with the Ice Theatre of New York (affectionately known as ITNY) in 2004 when we created a new website for them. 10 years later when they needed an update, they turned to us to update the design of the site and overhaul some of the content. We were able to use the same CMS we implemented for them a decade ago, while creating a clean new website with full screen video and e-commerce features."
