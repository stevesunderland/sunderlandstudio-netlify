description: "This project involved designing a logo and marketing site for an open-source software competition presented by my colleagues at [DrivenData](http://www.drivendata.co/) with the [Bonnie J. Addario Lung Cancer Foundation](http://www.lungcancerfoundation.org). I also implemented the front-end templates for this Django-based web application and created a series of illustrations for the project."
