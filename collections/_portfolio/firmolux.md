   Firmolux is a supplier of premium Venetian plaster. I designed and built a custom Shopify store to streamline their online shopping experience and inventory management. The website features a custom Shopify app that allows customers to customize the color of their plaster products by using popular paint swatches. It also allows wholesale customers to place their orders online.
