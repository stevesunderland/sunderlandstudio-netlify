title: "Classical TV"
description: "I was initially contracted by Classical TV to create magazine-style graphics for their web-based editorials. This quickly evolved into an evaluation of their branding and web design. I developed several apps for internet-connected TV including the Roku, Google, Yahoo and LG Smart TV platforms. I also prototyped a new responsive website that will deliver their extensive content library to all browsers and devices."
