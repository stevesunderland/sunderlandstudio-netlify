description: "Mindcurv is an e-commerce delivery platform based in Germany. They hired me to create their new website which was designed by [Nelleke van der Maas](https://www.behance.net/Nelleke) . This static website uses a variety of frameworks including [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) as a headless CMS and Roots as a static site generator. These tools enabled us to create an incredibly flexible, fast and secure website."
