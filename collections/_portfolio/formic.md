  title: Alex Koepsel, Formic
  quote: Steve is the best developer I've ever worked with. He built everything I threw at him and usually did it at lightning speed. He also has a unique capability to infer and expand upon our skeleton outlines and build out the entire website, while also making great suggestions. I highly recommend working with him.
