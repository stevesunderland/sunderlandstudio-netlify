  For this financial consulting firm, I crafted a digital experience that embodies their nature-inspired methodology. Drawing from the fluid dynamics of water and natural geometric patterns, the design creates an immersive yet intuitive journey for visitors.

  The site features custom WebGL effects and animations that bring subtle movement and depth to the design while maintaining a clean, minimal aesthetic. This balance creates an extremely unique website that is also easy to navigate. 

  This is a static website using Parcel as a static site generator, with Netlify CMS integration providing the client with straightforward content management capabilities without sacrificing speed or design integrity.

#   quote: "Steve is a pleasure to work with and I would strongly recommend him for graphic design and website needs. He was able to integrate with our technical needs to develop a website design that met everyone's requirements and provided the files in the way we needed to execute seamlessly. He also helped us to update our all marketing collateral in the new branding design to match the new site. He requires very little direction and is able to turn things around super fast. He is such a pleasure to work&nbsp;with."
