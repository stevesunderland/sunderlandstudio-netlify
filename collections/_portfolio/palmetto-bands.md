   Palmetto Bands is an online store for handmade elastic watch bands. This project involved the design and development of a new Shopify store. I helped them streamline their inventory management process and created a custom Shopify theme that allows shoppers to easily customize their watch bands.
testimonial:
  title: "Luis Bares, Palmetto Bands"
  quote: "I had incredibly high standards for Steve's work and was truly blown away with his professionalism and true skill in his craft. Our initial discussion about the concept for my Shopify site was effortless and Steve understood every functional requirement that my team relayed. The designs that Steve offered back were all top-notch, highly-responsive and custom sites that we could never have envisioned in such a quick turnaround. Highly recommend Steve for any Shopify development job, and given his expanded skill set, I'd hire him again for any web development support."
