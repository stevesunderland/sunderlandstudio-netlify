quote: "Steve worked with Formic through two rebrands - building our website from scratch with the first one, and then re-skinning it for the second. On both occasions, Steve was prompt, communicative, and delivered high quality work. Most impressively, he hit our aggressive timeline goals without balking at all. *Steve exceeded our (admittedly high) expectations, and I would absolutely recommend him to anyone considering his services.*"
