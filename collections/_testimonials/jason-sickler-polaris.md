quote: Steve designed and implemented Polaris Electro-Optics's website. His process was well-defined, he efficiently and quickly incorporated feedback through a number of mockup iterations, and he implemented it perfectly and in very short order. Very professional and reasonably priced. I give him the highest recommendation.
